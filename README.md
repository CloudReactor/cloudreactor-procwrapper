Wraps the execution of processes so that an API server
([CloudReactor](https://cloudreactor.io/))
can monitor and manage them.
Available as a standalone executable or as a python module.

## Features

* Runs either processes started with a command line or a python function you
supply
* Implements retries and time limits
* Injects secrets from AWS Secrets Manager, AWS S3, or local files and extracts
them into the process environment (for command-lines) or configuration (for
functions)
* When used with the CloudReactor service:
  * Reports when a process/function starts and when it exits, along with the
  exit code and runtime metadata (if running in AWS ECS or AWS Lambda)
  * Sends heartbeats, optionally with status information like the number of
  items processed
  * Prevents too many concurrent executions
  * Stops execution when manually stopped in the CloudReactor dashboard
  * Sends CloudReactor the data necessary to start the process / function if running in AWS ECS or AWS Lambda

## How it works

First, secrets and other configuration are fetched and resolved from
providers like AWS Secrets Manager, AWS S3, or the local filesystem.

Just before your code runs, the module requests the API server to create a
Task Execution associated with the Task name or UUID which you pass to the
module.
The API server may reject the request if too many instances of the Task are
currently running, but otherwise records that a Task Execution has started.
The module then passes control to your code.

While your code is running, it may report progress to the API server,
and the API server may signal that your Task stop execution (due to
user manually stopping the Task Execution), in which
case the module terminates your code and exits.

After your code finishes, the module informs the API server of
the exit code or result. CloudReactor monitors Tasks to ensure they
are still responsive, and keeps a history of the Executions of Tasks,
allowing you to view failures and run durations in the past.

### Auto-created Tasks

Before your Task is run (including this module),
the [AWS ECS CloudReactor Deployer](https://github.com/CloudReactor/aws-ecs-cloudreactor-deployer)
can be used to set it up in AWS ECS,
and inform CloudReactor of details of your Task.
That way CloudReactor can start and schedule your Task, and setup your
Task as a service.
See [CloudReactor python ECS QuickStart](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-python-ecs-quickstart)
for an example.

However, it may not be possible or desired to change your deployment process.
Instead, you may configure the Task to be *auto-created*.

Auto-created Tasks are created the first time your Task runs.
This means there is no need to inform the API server of the Task details
(during deployment) before it runs.
Instead, each time the module runs, it informs the API server of the
Task details at the same time as it requests the creation of a Task Execution.
One disadvantage of auto-created Tasks is that they are not available
in the CloudReactor dashboard until the first time they run.

When configuring a Task to be auto-created, you must specify the name
or UUID of the Run Environment in CloudReactor that the Task is
associated with. The Run Environment must be created ahead of time,
either by the Cloudreactor AWS Setup Wizard,
or manually in the CloudReactor dashboard.

You can also specify more Task properties, such as Alert Methods and
external links in the dashboard, by setting the environment variable
`PROC_WRAPPER_AUTO_CREATE_TASK_PROPS` set to a JSON-encoded object that has the
[CloudReactor Task schema](https://apidocs.cloudreactor.io/#operation/tasks_create).

### Execution Methods

CloudReactor currently supports three Execution Methods:

1) [AWS ECS (in Fargate)](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
2) [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
3) Unknown

If a Task is running in AWS ECS, CloudReactor is able to run additional
Task Executions, provided the details of running the Task is provided
during deployment with the AWS ECS CloudReactor Deployer, or if the
Task is configured to be auto-created, and this module is run. In the
second case, this module uses the ECS Metadata endpoint to detect
the ECS Task settings, and sends them to the API server. CloudReactor
can also schedule Tasks or setup long-running services using Tasks,
provided they are run in AWS ECS.

If a Task is running in AWS Lambda, CloudReactor is able to run additional
Task Executions after the first run of the function.

However, a Task may use the Unknown execution method if it is not running
in AWS ECS or Lambda. If that is the case, CloudReactor won't be able to
start the Task in the dashboard or as part of a Workflow,
schedule the Task, or setup a service with the Task. But the advantage is
that the Task code can be executed by any method available to you,
such as bare metal servers, VM's, or Kubernetes.
All Tasks in CloudReactor, regardless of execution method, have their
history kept and are monitored.

This module detects  the execution method your Task is
running with and sends that information to the API server, provided
you configure your Task to be auto-created.

### Passive Tasks

Passive Tasks are Tasks that CloudReactor does not manage. This means
scheduling and service setup must be handled by other means
(cron jobs, [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/), etc).
However, Tasks marked as services or that have a schedule will still be
monitored by CloudReactor, which will send notifications if
a service Task goes down or a Task does not run on schedule.

The module reports to the API server that auto-created Tasks are passive,
unless you specify the `--force-task-passive` commmand-line option or
set the environment variable `PROC_WRAPPER_TASK_IS_PASSIVE` to `FALSE`.
If a Task uses the Unknown Execution Method, it must be marked as passive,
because CloudReactor does not know how to manage it.

## Pre-requisites

If you just want to use this module to retry processes, limit execution time,
or fetch secrets, you can use offline mode, in which case no CloudReactor API
key is required. But CloudReactor offers a free tier so we hope you
[sign up](https://dash.cloudreactor.io/signup)
for a free account to enable monitoring and/or management.

If you want CloudReactor to be able to start your Tasks, you should use the
[Cloudreactor AWS Setup Wizard](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-aws-setup-wizard)
to configure your AWS environment to run Tasks in ECS Fargate.
You can skip this step if running in passive mode is OK for you.

If you want to use CloudReactor to manage or just monitor your Tasks,
you need to create a Run Environment and an API key in the CloudReactor
dashboard. The API key can be scoped to the Run Environment if you
wish. The key must have at least the Task access level, but for
an auto-created Task, it must have at least the Developer access level.

## Installation

### Nuitka

Standalone executables built by
[nuitka](https://nuitka.net/index.html)
for 64-bit Linux are available, located in `bin/nuitka`. These executables bundle
python so you don't need to have python installed on your machine. They also
bundle all optional library dependencies so you can fetch secrets from AWS
Secrets Manager and extract them with jsonpath-ng, for example.

Compared to executables built by PyInstaller (see below), they start up faster,
and most likely are more efficient at runtime.

#### RHEL or derivatives

To download and run the wrapper on a RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux 2 machine:

    RUN wget -nv https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/raw/5.0.1/bin/nuitka/al2/5.0.1/proc_wrapper.bin
    ENTRYPOINT ["proc_wrapper.bin"]

Example Dockerfiles of known working environments are available for
[Amazon Linux 2](tests/integration/nuitka_executable/docker_context_al2_amd64/)
and
[Fedora](tests/integration/nuitka_executable/docker_context_al2_amd64/Dockerfile).

Fedora 27 or later are supported.

#### Debian based systems

On a Debian based (including Ubuntu) machine:

    RUN wget -nv https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/raw/5.0.1/bin/nuitka/debian-amd64/5.0.1/proc_wrapper.bin
    ENTRYPOINT ["proc_wrapper.bin"]

See the example
[Dockerfile](tests/integration/nuitka_executable/docker_context_debian_amd64/Dockerfile) for a known working Debian environment.

Debian 10 (Buster) or later are supported.

### PyInstaller

Standalone executables built by [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) for 64-bit Linux and Windows are available, located in `bin/pyinstaller`.
These executables bundle
python so you don't need to have python installed on your machine. They also
bundle all optional library dependencies so you can fetch secrets from AWS
Secrets Manager and extract them with jsonpath-ng, for example. Compared to
executables built by nuitka, they start up slower but might be more reliable.

#### RHEL or derivatives

To download and run the wrapper on a RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux 2 machine:

    RUN wget -nv https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/raw/5.0.1/bin/pyinstaller/al2/5.0.1/proc_wrapper.bin
    ENTRYPOINT ["proc_wrapper.bin"]

Example Dockerfiles of known working environments are available for
[Amazon Linux 2](tests/integration/pyinstaller_executable/docker_context_al2_amd64/)
and
[Fedora](tests/integration/pyinstaller_executable/docker_context_al2_amd64/Dockerfile).

Fedora 27 or later are supported.

#### Debian based machines

On a Debian based (including Ubuntu) machine:

    RUN wget -nv https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/raw/5.0.1/bin/pyinstaller/debian-amd64/5.0.1/proc_wrapper.bin
    ENTRYPOINT ["proc_wrapper.bin"]

See the example
[Dockerfile](tests/integration/pyinstaller_executable/docker_context_debian_amd64/Dockerfile) for a known working Debian environment.

Debian 10 (Buster) or later are supported.

Special thanks to
[wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and
[PyInstaller Docker Images](https://github.com/cdrx/docker-pyinstaller)
for making it possible to cross-compile!

### When python is available

Install this module via pip (or your favorite package manager):

`pip install cloudreactor-procwrapper`

Fetching secrets from AWS Secrets Manager requires that
[boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) is available to import in your python environment.

JSON Path transformation requires that [jsonpath-ng](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng)
be available to import in your python environment.

You can get the tested versions of both dependencies in
[proc_wrapper-requirements.in](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/blob/main/proc_wrapper-requirements.in)
(suitable for use by [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/)) or the resolved requirements in
[proc_wrapper-requirements.txt](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper/blob/main/proc_wrapper-requirements.txt).

## Usage

There are two ways of using the module: wrapped mode and embedded mode.

### Wrapped mode

In wrapped mode, you pass a command line to the module which it
executes in a child process. The command can be implemented in whatever
programming language the running machine supports.

Instead of running

    somecommand --somearg x

you would run

    ./proc_wrapper somecommand --somearg x

assuming that are using the PyInstaller standalone executable, and that
you configure the program using environment variables.

Or, if you have python installed:

    python -m proc_wrapper somecommand --somearg x

Here are all the options:

    log:
      Logging settings

      -l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}, --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                            Log level
      --log-secrets         Log sensitive information
      --exclude-timestamps-in-log
                            Exclude timestamps in log (possibly because the log
                            stream will be enriched by timestamps automatically by
                            a logging service like AWS CloudWatch Logs)

    process:
      Process settings

      -w WORK_DIR, --work-dir WORK_DIR
                            Working directory. Defaults to the current directory.
      -c COMMAND_LINE, --command-line COMMAND_LINE
                            Command line to execute
      --shell-mode {auto,enable,disable}
                            Indicates if the process command should be executed in
                            a shell. Executing in a shell allows shell scripts,
                            commands, and expressions to be used, with the
                            disadvantage that termination signals may not be
                            propagated to child processes. Options are: enable --
                            Force the command to be executed in a shell; disable
                            -- Force the command to be executed without a shell;
                            auto -- Auto-detect the shell mode by analyzing the
                            command.
      --no-strip-shell-wrapping
                            Do not strip the command-line of shell wrapping like
                            "/bin/sh -c" that can be introduced by Docker when
                            using shell form of ENTRYPOINT and CMD.
      --no-process-group-termination
                            Send termination and kill signals to the wrapped
                            process only, instead of its process group (which is
                            the default). Sending to the process group allows all
                            child processes to receive the signals, even if the
                            wrapped process does not forward signals. However, if
                            your wrapped process manually handles and forwards
                            signals to its child processes, you probably want to
                            send signals to only your wrapped process.
      -t PROCESS_TIMEOUT, --process-timeout PROCESS_TIMEOUT
                            Timeout for process completion, in seconds. -1 means
                            no timeout, which is the default.
      -r PROCESS_MAX_RETRIES, --process-max-retries PROCESS_MAX_RETRIES
                            Maximum number of times to retry failed processes. -1
                            means to retry forever. Defaults to 0.
      --process-retry-delay PROCESS_RETRY_DELAY
                            Number of seconds to wait before retrying a process.
                            Defaults to 60.
      --process-check-interval PROCESS_CHECK_INTERVAL
                            Number of seconds to wait between checking the status
                            of processes. Defaults to 10.
      --process-termination-grace-period PROCESS_TERMINATION_GRACE_PERIOD
                            Number of seconds to wait after sending SIGTERM to a
                            process, but before killing it with SIGKILL. Defaults
                            to 30.

                            status update messages will not be read.
      --status-update-socket-port STATUS_UPDATE_SOCKET_PORT
                            The port used to receive status updates from the
                            process. Defaults to 2373.
      --status-update-message-max-bytes STATUS_UPDATE_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES
                            The maximum number of bytes status update messages can
                            be. Defaults to 65536.
      --status-update-interval STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL
                            Minimum of number of seconds to wait between sending
                            status updates to the API server. -1 means to not send
                            status updates except with heartbeats. Defaults to -1.

                            process environment for wrapped mode. By default, the
                            file format is assumed to be dotenv. Specify multiple
                            times to include multiple locations.

      --config-ttl CONFIG_TTL
                            Number of seconds to cache resolved environment
                            variables and configuration properties instead of
                            refreshing them when a process restarts. -1 means to
                            never refresh. Defaults to -1.

Wrapped mode is suitable for running in a shell on your own (virtual) machine
or in a Docker container. It requires multi-process support, as the module
runs at the same time as the command it wraps.

### Embedded mode

You can use embedded mode to execute python code from inside a python program.
Include the `proc_wrapper` package in your python project's
dependencies. To run a task you want to be monitored:

    from typing import Any, Mapping

    from proc_wrapper import ProcWrapper, ProcWrapperParams


    def fun(wrapper: ProcWrapper, cbdata: dict[str, int],
            config: Mapping[str, Any]) -> int:
        print(cbdata)
        return cbdata['a']


    # This is the function signature of a function invoked by AWS Lambda.
    def entrypoint(event: Any, context: Any) -> int:
        params = ProcWrapperParams()
        params.auto_create_task = True

        # If the Task Execution is running in AWS Lambda, CloudReactor can make
        # the associated Task available to run (non-passive) in the CloudReactor
        # dashboard or by API, after the wrapper reports its first execution.
        proc_wrapper_params.task_is_passive = False

        params.task_name = 'embedded_test_production'
        params.auto_create_task_run_environment_name = 'production'

        # For example only, in the real world you would use Secret Fetching;
        # see below.
        params.api_key = 'YOUR_CLOUDREACTOR_API_KEY'

        # In an AWS Lambda environment, passing the context and event allows
        # CloudReactor to monitor and manage this Task.
        proc_wrapper = ProcWrapper(params=params, runtime_context=context,
            input_value=event)

        x = proc_wrapper.managed_call(fun, {'a': 1, 'b': 2})
        # Should print 1
        print(x)

        return x

This is suitable for running in single-threaded environments like
AWS Lambda, or as part of a larger process that executes
sub-routines that should be monitored. See
[cloudreactor-python-lambda-quickstart](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-python-lambda-quickstart) for an example project that uses
proc_wrapper in a function run by AWS Lambda.

#### Embedded mode configuration

In embedded mode, besides setting properties of `ProcWrapperParams` in code,
`ProcWrapper` can be also configured in two ways:

First, using environment variables, as in wrapped mode.

Second, using the configuration dictionary. If the configuration dictionary
contains the key `proc_wrapper_params` and its value is a dictionary, the
keys and values in the dictionary will be used to to set these attributes in
`ProcWrapperParams`:

Keys that are marked with "Mutable" -- "No" in the table above can be
overridden when the configuration is reloaded after the `config_ttl` expires.

Keys that are marked as "Uses Resolved Config" -- "Yes" in the table above can
come from the resolved configuration after secret resolution (see below).

## Secret Fetching and Resolution

A common requirement is that deployed code / images do not contain secrets
internally which could be decompiled. Instead, programs should fetch secrets
from an external source in a secure manner. If your program runs in AWS, it
can make use of AWS's roles that have permission to access data in
Secrets Manager or S3. However, in many scenarios, having your program access
AWS directly has the following disadvantages:

1) Your program becomes coupled to AWS, so it is difficult to run locally or
switch to another infrastructure provider
2) You need to write code or use a library for each programming language you
use, so secret fetching is done in a non-uniform way
3) Writing code to merge and parse secrets from different sources is tedious

Therefore, proc_wrapper implements Secret Fetching and Resolution to solve
these problems so your programs don't have to. Both usage modes can fetch secrets from
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/),
AWS S3, or the local filesystem, and optionally extract embedded data
into the environment or a configuration dictionary. The environment is used to
pass values to processes run in wrapped mode,
while the configuration dictionary is passed to the callback function in
embedded mode.

proc_wrapper parses secret location strings that specify the how to resolve
a secret value. Each secret location string has the format:

`[PROVIDER_CODE:]<Provider specific address>[!FORMAT][|JP:<JSON Path expression>]`

### Secret Providers

Providers indicate the raw source of the secret data. The table below lists the
supported providers:

| Provider Code 	| Value Prefix              	| Provider                     	| Example Address                                             	| Required libs                                                               	| Notes                                                         	|
|---------------	|---------------------------	|------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------	|---------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `AWS_SM`      	| `arn:aws:secretsmanager:` 	| AWS Secrets Manager          	| `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:config` 	| [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) 	| Can also include version suffix like `-PPrpY`                 	|
| `AWS_S3`      	| `arn:aws:s3:::`           	| AWS S3 Object                	| `arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/staging/app1/config.json`       	| [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) 	|                                                               	|
| `FILE`        	| `file://`                 	| Local file                   	| `file:///home/appuser/app/.env`                                    	|                                                                             	| The default provider if no provider is auto-detected          	|
| `ENV`         	|                           	| The process environment      	| `SOME_TOKEN`                                                	|                                                                             	| The name of another environment variable                      	|
| `CONFIG`      	|                           	| The configuration dictionary 	| `$.db`                                                      	| [jsonpath-ng](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng)                         	| JSON path expression to extract the data in the configuration 	|
| `PLAIN`       	|                           	| Plaintext                    	| `{"user": "postgres", "password": "badpassword"}`           	|                                                                             	|                                                               	|

If you don't specify an explicit provider prefix in a secret location
(e.g. `AWS_SM:`), the provider can be auto-detected from the address portion
using the Value Prefix. For example the secret location
`arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/staging/app1/config.json` will be auto-detected
to with the AWS_S3 provider because it starts with `arn:aws:s3:::`.

### Secret Formats

Formats indicate how the raw string data is parsed into a secret value (which may be
a string, number, boolean, dictionary, or array). The table below lists the
supported formats:

| Format Code 	| Extensions      	| MIME types                                                                            	| Required libs                                        	| Notes                                            	|
|-------------	|-----------------	|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------	|
| `dotenv`    	| `.env`          	| None                                                                                  	| [dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) 	| Also auto-detected if location includes `.env.`  	|
| `json`      	| `.json`         	| `application/json`, `text/x-json`                                                     	|                                               	|  	|
| `yaml`      	| `.yaml`, `.yml` 	| `application/x-yaml`, `application/yaml`, `text/vnd.yaml`, `text/yaml`, `text/x-yaml` 	| [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org/)                        	| `safe_load()` is used for security               	|

The format of a secret value can be auto-detected from the extension or by the
MIME type if available. Otherwise, you may need to an explicit format code
(e.g. `!yaml`).

#### AWS Secrets Manager / S3 notes

[boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
is used to fetch secrets. It will try to access to AWS Secrets Manager
or S3 using environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` if they are set, or use the EC2 instance role, ECS task
role, or Lambda execution role if available.

For Secrets Manager, you can also use "partial ARNs"
(without the hyphened suffix) as keys.
In the example above

    arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:config

could be used to fetch the same secret, provided there are no conflicting secret ARNs.
This allows you to get the latest version of the secret.

If the secret was stored in Secrets Manager as binary, the
corresponding value will be set to the Base-64 encoded value.

If you're deploying a python function using AWS Lambda, note that boto3 is
already included in the available packages, so there's no need to include it
(unless the bundled version isn't compatible).

### Secret Tranformation

Fetching secrets can be relatively expensive and it makes sense to group related
secrets together. Therefore it is common to store dictionaries (formatted
as JSON or YAML) as secrets. However, each desired environment variable
or configuration property may only consist of a fragment of the dictionary.
For example, given the JSON-formatted dictionary

    {
      "username": "postgres",
      "password": "badpassword"
    }

you may want to populate the environment variable `DB_USERNAME` with
`postgres`.

To facilitate this, dictionary fragments can be extracted to individual
environment variables using [jsonpath-ng](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng).
To specify that a variable be extracted from a dictionary using
a JSON Path expression, append `|JP:` followed by the JSON Path expression
to the secret location string. For example, if the AWS Secrets Manager
ARN

    arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY

contains the dictionary above, then the secret location string

    arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY|JP:$.username

will resolve to `postgres` as desired.

If you do something similar to get the password from the same JSON value,
proc_wrapper is smart enough to cache the fetched dictionary, so that the
raw data is only fetched once.

Since JSON path expressions yield a list of results, the secrets fetcher
implements the following rules to transform the list to the final value:

1. If the list of results has a single value, that value is used as the
final value, unless `[*]` is appended to the JSON path expression.
2. Otherwise, the final value is the list of results

#### Fetching from another environment variable

In some deployment scenarios, multiple secrets can be injected into a
single environment variable as a JSON encoded object. In that case,
the module can extract secrets using the *ENV* secret source. For example,
you may have arranged to have the environment variable DB_CONFIG injected
with the JSON encoded value:

    { "username": "postgres", "password": "nohackme" }

Then to extract the username to the environment variable DB_USERNAME you
you would add the environment variable DB_USER_FOR_PROC_WRAPPER_TO_RESOLVE
set to

    ENV:DB_CONFIG|JP:$.username

### Secret injection into environment and configuration

Now let's use secret location strings to
inject the values into the environment (for wrapped mode)
and/or the the configuration dictionary (for embedded mode). proc_wrapper
supports two methods of secret injection which can be combined together:

* Top-level fetching
* Secrets Resolution

### Top-level fetching

Top-level fetching refers to fetching a dictionary that contains multiple secrets
and populating the environment / configuration dictionary with it.
To use top-level fetching, you specify the secret locations
from which you want to fetch the secrets and the corresponding values are
merged together into the environment / configuration.

To use top-level fetching in wrapped mode, populate the
environment variables `PROC_WRAPPER_ENV_LOCATIONS` with a comma-separated
list of secret locations, or use the command-line option
`--env-locations <secret_location>` one or more times. Secret location
strings passed in via `PROC_WRAPPER_ENV_LOCATIONS` or `--env-locations`
will be parsed as `dotenv` files unless format is auto-detected or
explicitly specified.

To use top-level fetching in embedded mode, set the `ProcWrapperParams` property
`config_locations` to a list of secret locations. Alternatively, you can set
the environment variable `PROC_WRAPPER_CONFIG_LOCATIONS` to a comma-separated
list, and this will be picked up automatically. Secret location values
will be parsed as JSON unless the format is auto-detected or explicitly
specified. The `config` argument
passed to the your callback function will contain a merged dictionary of all
fetched and parsed dictionary values. For example:

    def callback(wrapper: ProcWrapper, cbdata: str,
            config: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        return "super" + cbdata + config["username"]


    def main():
        params = ProcWrapperParams()

        # Optional: you can set an initial configuration dictionary which will
        # have its values included in the final configuration unless overridden.
        params.initial_config = {
            "log_level": "DEBUG"
        }

        # You can omit this if you set PROC_WRAPPER_CONFIG_LOCATIONS environment
        # variable to the same ARN
        params.config_locations = [
            "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY",
            # More secret locations can be added here, and their values will
            # be merged
        ]

        wrapper = ProcWrapper(params=params)

        # Returns "superduperpostgres"
        return wrapper.managed_call(callback, "duper")

#### Merging Secrets

Top-level fetching can potentially fetch multiple dictionaries which are
merged together in the final environment / configuration dictionary.
The default merge strategy (`DEEP`) merges recursively, even dictionaries
in lists. The `SHALLOW` merge strategy just overwrites top-level keys, with later
secret locations taking precedence. However, if you include the
[mergedeep](https://github.com/clarketm/mergedeep) library, you can also
set the merge strategy to one of:

* `REPLACE`
* `ADDITIVE`
* `TYPESAFE_REPLACE`
* `TYPESAFE_ADDITIVE`

so that nested lists can be appended to instead of replaced (in the case of the
`ADDITIVE` strategies), or errors will be raised if incompatibly-typed values
are merged (in the case of the `TYPESAFE` strategies). In wrapped mode,
the merge strategy can be set with the `--config-merge-strategy` command-line
argument or `PROC_WRAPPER_CONFIG_MERGE_STRATEGY` environment variable. In
embedded mode, the merge strategy can be set in the
`config_merge_strategy` string property of `ProcWrapperParams`.

### Secret Resolution

Secret Resolution substitutes configuration or environment values that are
secret location strings with the computed values of those strings. Compared
to Secret Fetching, Secret Resolution is more useful when you want more
control over the names of variables or when you have secret values deep
inside your configuration.

In wrapped mode, if you want to set the environment variable `MY_SECRET` with
a value fetched
from AWS Secrets Manager, you would set the environment variable
`MY_SECRET_FOR_PROC_WRAPPER_TO_RESOLVE` to a secret location string
which is ARN of the secret, for example:

    arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY

(The `_FOR_PROC_WRAPPER_TO_RESOLVE` suffix of environment variable names is
removed during resolution. It can also be configured with the `PROC_WRAPPER_RESOLVABLE_ENV_VAR_NAME_SUFFIX` environment variable.)

In embedded mode, if you want the final configuration dictionary to look like:

    {
      "db_username": "postgres",
      "db_password": "badpassword",
      ...
    }


The initial configuration dictionary would look like:

    {
      "db_username__to_resolve": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY|JP:$.username",
      "db_password__to_resolve": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:db-PPrpY|JP:$.password",

      ...
    }

(The `__to_resolve` suffix (with 2 underscores!) of keys is removed during
resolution. It can also be configured with the `resolved_config_property_name_suffix`
property of `ProcWrapperParams`.)

proc_wrapper can also resolve keys in embedded dictionaries, like:

    {
      "db": {
        "username__to_resolve": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:config-PPrpY|JP:$.username",
        "password__to_resolve":
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:config-PPrpY|JP:$.password",
        ...
      },
      ...
    }

up to a maximum depth that you can control with `ProcWrapperParams.max_config_resolution_depth` (which defaults to 5). That would resolve to

    {
      "db": {
        "username": "postgres",
        "password": "badpassword"
        ...
      },
      ...
    }

You can also inject entire dictionaries, like:

    {
      "db__to_resolve": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:1234567890:secret:config-PPrpY",
      ...
    }

which would resolve to

    {
      "db": {
        "username": "postgres",
        "password": "badpassword"
      },
      ...
    }

To enable secret resolution in wrapped mode, set environment variable `PROC_WRAPPER_RESOLVE_SECRETS` to `TRUE`. In embedded mode, secret
resolution is enabled by default; set the
`max_config_resolution_iterations` property of `ProcWrapperParams` to `0`
to disable resolution.

Secret resolution is run multiple times so that if a resolved value contains
a secret location string, it will be resolved on the next pass. By default,
proc_wrapper limits the maximum number of resolution passes to 3 but you
can control this with the environment variable
`PROC_WRAPPER_MAX_CONFIG_RESOLUTION_ITERATIONS` in embedded mode,
or by setting the `max_config_resolution_iterations` property of
`ProcWrapperParams` in wrapped mode.

### Environment Projection

During secret fetching and secret resolution, proc_wrapper internally maintains
the computed environment as a dictionary which may have embedded lists and
dictionaries. However, the final environment passed to the process is a flat
dictionary containing only string values. So proc_wrapper converts
all top-level values to strings using these rules:

* Lists and dictionaries are converted to their JSON-encoded string value
* Boolean values are converted to their upper-cased string representation
(e.g. the string `FALSE` for the boolean value `false`)
* The `None` value is converted to the empty string
* All other values are converted using python's `str()` function

### Secrets Refreshing

You can set a Time to Live (TTL) on the duration that secret values are cached.
Caching helps reduce expensive lookups of secrets and bandwidth usage.

In wrapped mode, set the TTL of environment variables set from secret locations
using the `--config-ttl` command-line argument or
`PROC_WRAPPER_CONFIG_TTL_SECONDS` environment variable.
If the process exits, you have configured the script to retry,
and the TTL has expired since the last fetch,
proc_wrapper will re-fetch the secrets
and resolve them again, for the environment passed to the next invocation of
your process.

In embedded mode, set the TTL of configuration dictionary values set from
secret locations by setting the `config_ttl` property of
`ProcWrapperParams`. If 1) your callback function raises an exception, 2) you have
configured the script to retry; and 3) the TTL has expired since the last fetch,
proc_wrapper will re-fetch the secrets
and resolve them again, for the configuration passed to the next invocation of
the callback function.

## Status Updates

### Status Updates in Wrapped Mode

While your process in running, you can send status updates to
CloudReactor by using the StatusUpdater class. Status updates are shown in
the CloudReactor dashboard and allow you to track the current progress of a
Task and also how many items are being processed in multiple executions
over time.

In wrapped mode, your application code would send updates to the
proc_wrapper program via UDP port 2373 (configurable with the PROC_WRAPPER_STATUS_UPDATE_PORT environment variable).
If your application code is in python, you can use the provided
StatusUpdater class to do this:

    from proc_wrapper import StatusUpdater

    with StatusUpdater() as updater:
        updater.send_update(last_status_message="Starting ...")
        success_count = 0

        for i in range(100):
            try:
                do_work()
                success_count += 1
                updater.send_update(success_count=success_count)
            except Exception:
                failed_count += 1
                updater.send_update(failed_count=failed_count)

        updater.send_update(last_status_message="Finished!")

### Status Updates in Embedded Mode

In embedded mode, your callback in python code can use the wrapper instance to
send updates:

    from typing import Any, Mapping

    import proc_wrapper
    from proc_wrapper import ProcWrapper

    def fun(wrapper: ProcWrapper, cbdata: dict[str, int],
            config: Mapping[str, Any]) -> int:
        wrapper.update_status(last_status_message="Starting the fun ...")

        success_count = 0
        error_count = 0
        for i in range(100):
            try:
                do_work()
                success_count += 1
            except Exception:

                error_count += 1
            wrapper.update_status(success_count=success_count,
                    error_count=error_count)

        wrapper.update_status(last_status_message="The fun is over.")

        return cbdata["a"]

    params = ProcWrapperParams()
    params.auto_create_task = True
    params.auto_create_task_run_environment_name = "production"
    params.task_name = "embedded_test"
    params.api_key = "YOUR_CLOUDREACTOR_API_KEY"

    proc_wrapper = ProcWrapper(params=params)
    proc_wrapper.managed_call(fun, {"a": 1, "b": 2})
